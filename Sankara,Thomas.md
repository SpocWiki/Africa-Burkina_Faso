> Thomas Isidore Noël Sankara (21 December 1949 – 15 October 1987) 
> was a Burkinabé military officer, Marxist and Pan-Africanist revolutionary 
> who served as the President of Burkina Faso from 1983, 
> following his takeover in a coup, until his assassination in 1987.
>
> After Sankara was appointed Prime Minister of the Republic of Upper Volta in 1983, 
> he had political disputes with the sitting government that resulted in his eventual imprisonment. 
> 
> While he was under house arrest, a group of revolutionaries seized power on his behalf 
> in a popular coup later that year.
>
> At the age of 33, Sankara became the President of the Republic of Upper Volta 
> and launched an unprecedented series of social, ecological, and economic reforms 
> that were part of what he referred to as the people's democratic revolution. 
> 
> In 1984, Sankara oversaw the renaming of the country as Burkina Faso 
> ('land of the upright people'), and personally wrote its national anthem. 
> 
> His foreign policy was centered on anti-imperialism 
> and he rejected loans and capital from such organizations as the International Monetary Fund. 
> However, he welcomed some foreign aid in an effort to boost the domestic economy, 
> diversify the sources of assistance, and make Burkina Faso self-sufficient.
>
> His domestic policies included famine prevention, agrarian expansion, land reform, 
> and suspending rural poll taxes, as well as a nationwide literacy campaign 
> and vaccination program to reduce meningitis, yellow fever and measles. 
> 
> Sankara's health programmes distributed millions of doses of vaccines to children across Burkina Faso. 
> 
> His government also focused on building schools, health centres, water reservoirs, 
> and infrastructure projects. 
> 
> He combatted desertification of the Sahel by planting more than 10 million trees. 
> Socially, his government enforced 
> the prohibition of female circumcision, forced marriages and polygamy. 
> Sankara reinforced his populist image by ordering the sale of luxury vehicles 
> and properties owned by the government in order to reduce costs. 
> 
> In addition, he banned what he considered the luxury of air conditioning in government offices, 
> and homes of politicians. 
> 
> He established Cuban-inspired Committees for the Defense of the Revolution 
> to serve as a new foundation of society and promote popular mobilization. 
> 
> His Popular Revolutionary Tribunals prosecuted public officials 
> charged with graft, political crimes and corruption, 
> considering such elements of the state counter-revolutionaries. 
> 
> Amnesty International criticised his government for alleged human rights violations, 
> such as arbitrary detentions of political opponents.
>
> Sankara's revolutionary programmes and reforms for African self-reliance 
> made him an icon to many of Africa's poverty-stricken nations, 
> and the president remained popular with a substantial majority of his country's citizens, 
> as well as those outside Burkina Faso. 
> 
> Some of his policies alienated elements of the former ruling class, including tribal leaders — 
> and the governments of France and its ally the Ivory Coast.
>
> On 15 October 1987, Sankara was assassinated by troops led by Blaise Compaoré, 
> who assumed leadership of the country shortly thereafter. 
> 
> Compaoré retained power until the 2014 Burkina Faso uprising. 
> In 2021, he was formally charged by a military tribunal with the murder of Sankara 
> and found guilty.
